# F1 Race Predictor 🏎️💨

Welcome to my **F1 Race Predictor** project! 🚗💨

As a **huge Formula 1 fan** and a **proud Max Verstappen supporter** 🦁, this project is born from my passion for the sport and my mission to predict race outcomes using historical data and machine learning models. I believe Max is the 🐐, and I'm here to take his dominance to the next level by predicting his success based on data! 🚀

> **"Simply lovely!"** — Max Verstappen 🦁 (Because that's how I feel about this project!)

## Features 🌟

- **Race & Qualifying Data**: Get real-time data from the **2024** and **2025 F1 sessions** to predict race outcomes.
- **Machine Learning** 🤖: Uses **Gradient Boosting Regressor** to predict race times based on **qualifying performance**.
- **Constructor's Championship Data**: Analyzes **car performance** from the **Constructor's Championship** 🏆 to enhance predictions.

## How It Works 🛠️

This project leverages the **FastF1** library to retrieve real-time and historical Formula 1 data. I then apply machine learning models, primarily using the **Gradient Boosting Regressor**, to predict driver performance in races based on qualifying data and their car's performance.

## Dependencies 🔧

- **FastF1**: Python library to fetch **F1 data** (qualifying, race results).
- **pandas**: Data manipulation & cleaning 📊.
- **sklearn**: Machine learning algorithms 🧠.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations ➗.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started, simply **clone** the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/f1-race-predictor.git
cd f1-race-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Predictor 🏁
To run the predictor, execute the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
This will load the race and qualifying data, train the model, and predict the race times of drivers based on their qualifying performances.

Contributing 🤝
As a dedicated F1 fan, I'm always excited about improving this project! Feel free to fork, raise issues, or contribute to making this model even better. Let’s make Max Verstappen 🦁 proud! 💪
